Telecom Network Performance Analysis

Objective: Analyze network performance across different regions and detect high-latency areas.

Key Features:

Monitor call drop rates and data speed.

Identify regions with high network failures.

Generate reports on network uptime vs downtime.

SQL Concepts Used: Group By, Window Functions, Case Statements.

SQL Schema & Queries:

-- Create Tables
CREATE TABLE network_performance (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    region VARCHAR(100),
    tower_id INT,
    avg_latency_ms DECIMAL(10,2),
    call_drop_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    data_speed_mbps DECIMAL(10,2),
    uptime_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    recorded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert Sample Data
INSERT INTO network_performance (region, tower_id, avg_latency_ms, call_drop_rate, data_speed_mbps, uptime_percentage) 
VALUES 
('North', 101, 45.2, 1.5, 50.2, 99.1),
('South', 102, 80.5, 3.2, 30.7, 95.6),
('East', 103, 60.3, 2.1, 40.8, 97.3);

-- Identify Regions with High Call Drop Rate
SELECT region, AVG(call_drop_rate) AS avg_call_drop 
FROM network_performance 
GROUP BY region 
HAVING AVG(call_drop_rate) > 2.5;

-- Find Areas with Low Data Speed
SELECT region, tower_id, data_speed_mbps 
FROM network_performance 
WHERE data_speed_mbps < 40 
ORDER BY data_speed_mbps ASC;

-- Network Uptime Performance by Region
SELECT region, AVG(uptime_percentage) AS avg_uptime 
FROM network_performance 
GROUP BY region 
ORDER BY avg_uptime DESC;
